     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                         Novice Examples
                         ---------------

N01 - Simple example to demonstrate how the GEANT4 basic framework works.
      No physics involved, only tracking on a simple geometry.
N02 - Simulation of a simplified fixed target experiment.
      Includes a simple parameterised geometry. Defines a transverse
      uniform magnetic field. Include standard EM physics for gammas,
      charged leptons and charged hadrons. Includes visualization and
      detector response.
N03 - Simulation of a simple sample Calorimeter setup.
      Shows the usage of 'replicated' volumes in the geometry. Defines
      user commands for primaries generation (isotropic random distribution).
      Defines a transverse uniform magnetic field. Include detector
      response and statistics on relevant quantities. Include a tutorial
      for visualization, exercising different visualization drivers.
N04 - Defines a simplified collider detector setup.
      Demonstrates interfacing to the PYTHIA primary generator. Includes
      the definition of a 'readout' geometry. Defines all ordinary physics
      processes for leptons and hadrons. Exercises event filtering using
      the stacking mechanism. Includes visualization.
N05 - Implements a setup for fast-parameterisation.
      Provides a simple shower parameterisation for e+/e-/gamma in a
      EM calorimeter, and a pi+/pi- parameterisation using ghost volumes.
      Implements parameterised detector response.
N06 - Simulation of optical photons generation and transport.
      Defines optical surfaces and exercises optical physics processes
      (Cerenkov, Scintillation, Absorption, Rayleigh, ...). Uses stacking
      mechanism to count the secondary particles generated.
N07 - Implements three simplified sandwitch calorimeters.
      Shows how to modify part of the geometry setup at run-time. Includes
      detector description parameterisation by materials. Demonstrates
      sharing of a sensitive detector definition for different sub-detectors.
      Defines different geometrical regions with different production
      thresholds. Shows customization of the G4Run.
