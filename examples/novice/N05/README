                            ExampleN05
                            ----------

ExampleN05 provides examples of the use of parameterisation facilities.

Geometry, sensitive detector, hits, processes are defined respectively in:

	ExN05DetectorConstruction
	ExN05CalorimeterSD
	ExN05CalorimeterHit
	ExN05PhysicsList

The particularities are:

      o The parameterisation models:

	      o ExN05EMShowerModel which provides a crude
		parameterisation for e+/e-/gamma. This model
		is bound to the EM calorimeter.

	      o ExN05PionShowerModel: an even more crude
		parameterisation for pi+/pi-. This model
		is bound to a ghost volume.

		Those two models produces "hits": ie the energy
		of the incident particle is distributed into
		the volume of the envelope throught energy spots
		(class ExN05EnergySpot), those energy spots being
		recorded in the sensitive detector at this point
		if any.

		They are rather similar from a technical point of vue.
		They both make use of a private G4Navigator to set
		their energy spots into the sensitive volumes.
		However, we don't take car of putting every spot into
		a sensitive (which is recommended in a "serious"
		parameterisation !).

		Those two models trigger their parameterisation
		on the first step the particle does in the envelope,
		but it would be perfectly possible to wait that the
		particle is far enough from the boundary of the envelope
		for example.

	      o ExN0PiModel: just there to show how a parameterisation
		can create secondaries, but not used.

      o ExN05PhysicsList: AddParameterisation(). A method which
	sets the G4FastSimulationManagerProcess in the process
	manager of all the particles. This process provides
	the INTERFACE between the tracking and the parameterisation
	models.

      o ExN05DetectorConstruction: in the .cc file, the parameterisation
	models are built and bound to envelopes:

	      o ExN05EMShowerModel is bound to the electromagnetic
		calorimeter

	      o ExN05PionShowerModel is bound to a ghost volume
		which encompasses the electromagnetic and
		hadronic calorimters
