                            Example B2
                            ----------

 This example simulates a simplified fixed target experiment.

 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
     The setup consists of a target followed by six chambers of increasing
     transverse size. These chambers are located in a region called the Tracker
     region. Their shape are boxes, constructed as simple boxes 
     (in B2aDetectorConstruction) and as parametrised volumes 
     (in B2bDetectorConstruction), see also B2bChamberParameterisation class.

     The default geometry is constructed in the detector construction class.
     One can change the materials of the target and the chambers
     interactively via the commands defined in B2aDetectorMessenger
     (or B2bDetectorMessenger). For example:

     /B2/det/setTargetMaterial G4_WATER
     /B2/det/setChamberMaterial G4_Ar
 
     In addition, a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied (see
     B2MagneticField and B2aDetectorMessenger, B2bDetectorMessenger classes) 
     and set interactively. For example:

     /B2/det/setField 0.2 tesla
 
 2- PHYSICS LIST

     The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
     in this example are set in the FTFP_BERT physics list. This physics
     list requires data files for low energy electromagnetic processes which
     path is defined via the G4LEDATA envirnoment variable.
 
     In addition, the build-in interactive command:
	         /process/(in)activate processName
     allows the user to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.

 3- PRIMARY GENERATOR

     The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
     target perpendicular to the entrance face. The type of the particle
     and its energy are set in the B2PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
     be changed via the G4 build-in commands of the G4ParticleGun class.
  
 4- RUNS and EVENTS
 
     A run is a set of events.
 
     The user has control:
        - at Begin and End of each run (class B2RunAction)
        - at Begin and End of each event (class B2EventAction)
        - at Begin and End of each track (class TrackingAction, not used here)
	- at End of each step (class SteppingAction, not used here)

 5- USER LIMITS
 
    This example also illustrates how to introduce tracking constraints
    like maximum step length, minimum kinetic energy etc. via the G4UserLimits
    class and associated G4StepLimiter and G4UserSpecialCuts processes.    
    See B2aDetectorConstruction (or B2bDetectorConstruction).

    The maximum step limit in the tracker region can be set by the interactive
    command (see B2aDetectorMessenger, B2bDetectorMessenger classes). 
    For example:

    /B2/det/stepMax 1.0 mm

 6- DETECTOR RESPONSE
 
     A HIT is a step per step record of all the information needed to
     simulate and analyse the detector response.
 
     In this example the Tracker chambers are considered to be the detector.
     Therefore, the chambers are declared 'sensitive detectors' (SD) in
     the B2aDetectorConstruction (or B2bDetectorConstruction) class.
     They are associated with an instance of the B2TrackerSD class.
 
     Then, a Hit is defined as a set of 4 informations per step, inside
     the chambers, namely:
        - the track identifier (an integer),
	- the chamber number,
 	- the total energy deposit in this step, and
 	- the position of the energy deposit.

     A given hit is an instance of the class B2TrackerHit which is created
     during the tracking of a particle, step by step, in the method
     B2TrackerSD::ProcessHits(). This hit is inserted in a HitsCollection. 

     The HitsCollection is printed at the end of each event (via the method
     B2TrackerSD::EndOfEvent()), under the control of the command:
     /hits/verbose 2

 The following paragraphs are common to all basic examples

 A- VISUALISATION

   The visualization manager is set via the G4VisExecutive class
   in the main() function in exampleB2a.cc (or exampleB2b.cc).    
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via a set of /vis/ commands
   in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from
   the main function when the example is used in interactive running mode.

   By default, vis.mac opens an OpenGL viewer.
   The user can switch to other graphics systems by commenting out this line
   and instead uncommenting one of the other /vis/open statements, such as
   HepRepFile or DAWNFILE (which produce files that can be viewed with the
   HepRApp and DAWN viewers, respectively).

   The DAWNFILE, HepRepFile drivers are always available
   (since they require no external libraries), but the OGL driver requires:
     1- the visualisation & interfaces categories have been compiled
        with the environment variable G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER.
     2- exampleB2a.cc has been compiled with G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX.
   (This is best done through Configure or CMake.)

   For more information on visualization, including information on how to
   install and run DAWN, OpenGL and HepRApp, see the visualization tutorials,
   for example,
   http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/Presentations/vis/G4[VIS]Tutorial/G4[VIS]Tutorial.html
   (where [VIS] can be replaced by DAWN, OpenGL and HepRApp)

   The tracks are automatically drawn at the end of each event, accumulated
   for all events and erased at the beginning of the next run.

 B- USER INTERFACES
 
   The user command interface is set via the G4UIExecutive class
   in the the main() function in exampleB2a.cc 
   The selection of the user command interface is then done automatically 
   according to the Geant4 configuration. The default command interface, 
   called G4UIterminal, is done via a standard G4cin/G4cout.
   On Linux and Sun-cc one can use a smarter command interface G4UItcsh. 
   It is enough to set the environment variable G4UI_USE_TCSH before compiling 
   exampleB2a.cc (or exampleB2b.cc).
 
 
 C- HOW TO RUN
 
    - compile and link to generate an executable
        % cd B2/B2a 
        % make
 
    - execute exampleB2a in the 'interactive mode' with visualization
        % exampleB2a
      and type in the commands from run1.mac line by line:  
        Idle> /tracking/verbose 1 
        Idle> /run/beamOn 1
        Idle> ...
        Idle> exit
      or
        Idle> /control/execute run1.mac  or run2.mac 
        ....
        Idle> exit

    - execute exampleB2a in the 'batch' mode from macro files 
      (without visualization)
        % exampleB2a run2.mac
        % exampleB2a exampleB2.in > exampleB2.out
