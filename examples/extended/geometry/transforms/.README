/*! \page ExampleTransform Example Transform

This extended example demonstrates various ways of definition of the 
3D transformations for placing volumes. It is defined with use of classes
from the common examples repository.

The geometry setup consists of two trapezoid volumes which are placed 
in a world so that their axial symmetry axis is in given theta and phi 
polar angles. The various ways of placement are implemented in the 
TrDetectorConstruction class in the following private functions:
 - PlaceWithDirectMatrix()
 - PlaceWithInverseMatrix()
 - PlaceWithAxialRotations()
 - PlaceWithEulerAngles()
 - PlaceWithReflections()
which are then called from the TrDetectorConstruction::Construct() function.
All methods define exactly same geometry except for the placement 
with reflection where trapezoids are placed with their symmetry axis 
in parallel with z-axis in order to make easier to check reflection 
visually. 

The method of placement can be selected interactively via the command
(see TrDetectorConstructionMessenger):
\verbatim
/transform/setMethod method
\endverbatim

The example is defined with use of classes from the common examples repository,
that's why it has to be compiled in two steps (the first step has to be done 
only once):
\verbatim
% cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/new/geometry/transform
% make setup
% make
\endverbatim

To run example:
\verbatim
% transform
PreInit> /transform/setMethod WithDirectMatrix
PreInit> /run/initialize
Init> /run/beamOn 1
\endverbatim
