                     GDML detector sensitivity
                     -------------------------

This example demonstrates the usage of the GDML auxiliary information for
associating a sensitive detector to a volume.

The detector construction consists of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses a
GDML file and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user can also write
her/his own GDML file and use it as the primary input format for her/his Geant4
application.

A simple GDML files is provided:
- auxiliary.gdml, showing association of a volume with the auxiliary
  information, related to the sensitive detector.

HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?

- You need to have built the persistency/gdml plugin module by having
  set G4LIB_BUILD_GDML variable in your environment.
  It is also required you specify the path where the XercesC XML parser
  package is installed in your system, through the variable XERCESCROOT.

- Compile and link to generate the executable:
 	      % make

- Execute the application.
  o For parsing interactively the GDML file:
 	      % gdml_det auxiliary.gdml
