This directory includes examples demonstrating the use of optical processes
in the simulation.

Multi-purpose detector setup implementing:
(1) scintillation inside a bulk scintillator with PMTs
(2) large wall of small PMTs opposite a Cerenkov slab to show the cone
(3) plastic scintillator with wave-length-shifting fiber readout.
