/*! \page README_extended Geant4 Extended Examples

The set of "extended" examples is covering various 
use-cases and may require some additional libraries besides of Geant4. 

\section ext_s1 Extended level examples:

- analysis
   - Histogramming through the AIDA interface
- biasing
   - Examples of event biasing, scoring and reverse-MC-
- common
   - A set of common classes which can be reused in other examples demonstrating
     just a particular feature  
- electromagnetic
   - Specific EM physics simulation with histogramming
- errorpropagation
   - Use of the error propagation utility (Geant4e)
- eventgenerator
   - Applications using interface to HepMC
- exoticphysics
   - Exotic simulation applications (classical magnetic monopole, etc...)
- field
   - Specific simulation setups in magnetic field
- g3tog3
   - Examples of usage of the g3tog4 converter tool
- geometry
   - Specific geometry examples and tools: OLAP tool for detection
     of overlapping geometries
- hadronic
   - Specific hadronic physics simulation with histogramming
- medical
   - Specific examples for medical physics applications
- optical
   - Examples of generic optical processes simulation setups
- parallel
   - Examples of event-level parallelism in Geant4 using the
     TOP-C distribution, and MPI technique
- parameterisations
   - Examples for fast shower parameterisations according to specific models
- persistency
   - Persistency of geometry (GDML or ASCII) and simulation output
- radioactivedecay
   - Examples to simulate the decays of radioactive isotopes and
     induced radioactivity resulted from nuclear interactions
- runAndEvent
   - Examples to demonstrate how to connect the information between
     primary particles and hits and utilize user-information classes
- visualization
   - Specific visualization features and graphical customisations

\section ext_s2 Common classes for extended examples:

In order to reduce code duplication and to reduce the number of variants of 
the code of same kind, we define a set of common classes which
can be reused in "feature" examples demonstrating just a particular feature.
This module is going to be enhanced in future. Currently it provides 
the following sets of classes:

- \ref extended_common_analysis :
  ExG4HbookAnalysisManager - the analysis manager class for HBOOK

- \ref extended_common_detectorConstruction :
  two simple detector construction classes with a messenger

- \ref extended_common_physicsList :
  ExG4PhysicsList00 - physics list with geantino and chargedgeantino only

- \ref extended_common_primaryGenerator :
  two simple primary generator classes (with G4ParticleGun and
  G4ParticleGeneralSource)

- \ref extended_common_userActions :
  event action and run action classes with messengers
