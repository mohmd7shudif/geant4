    How to plot a depth dose profile in a rectangular box.    

	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 The geometry consists of a stack of one or several blocks of homogenous
 material, called absorbers.
 Optionally, each absorber can be divided in thinner layers (replica)
     	
 A minimum of 5 parameters define the geometry :
    - the number of absorbers (NbOfAbsor)	
    - the material of each absorber,
    - the thickness of each absorber,
    - the tranverse dimension of the stack (sizeYZ),
    - the number of divisions of each absorber (NbOfDivisions)
	 	
 In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.
 	
 The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
 but all of the above parameters can be changed interactively via
 the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST
 
 Physics lists can be local (eg. in this example) or from G4 kernel
 physics_lists subdirectory.
     
 Local physics lists:	 
 - "local"	standard EM physics with current 'best' options setting.
                these options are explicited in PhysListEmStandard
			
 From geant4/source/physics_lists/builders:	 
  - "emstandard_opt0" recommended standard EM physics for LHC
  - "emstandard_opt1" best CPU performance standard physics for LHC
  - "emstandard_opt2"     
  - "emstandard_opt3" best current advanced EM options. 
                      analog to "local" above  
  - "emlivermore"  low-energy EM physics using Livermore data
  - "empenelope"   low-energy EM physics implementing Penelope models
      
 Physics lists and options can be (re)set with UI commands
    
 Please, notice that options set through G4EmProcessOPtions are global, eg
 for all particle types. In G4 builders, it is shown how to set options per
 particle type.

 	 
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the
 left face of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set 
 in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can be changed via the G4 
 build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
 this example).
	
 In addition one can choose randomly the impact point of the incident
 particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
 PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.
	 	
 A RUN is a set of events.
 	
 				
 4- VISUALIZATION
 
 The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
 > /control/execute vis.mac
 	
 The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
 	
 The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
 or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.
 	
 	
 5- HOW TO START ?
 
 - compile and link to generate an executable
 	% cd geant4/examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm1
 	% gmake
 		
 - execute TestEm11 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% TestEm11   run01.mac
 		
 - execute TestEm11 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% TestEm11
 	....
 	Idle> type your commands
 	....
 	Idle> exit
	

 6- TRACKING  and STEP MAX
 
 Testem11 computes the total energy deposited along the trajectory of 
 the incident particle : the so-called longitudinal energy profile,
 or depth dose distribution.
 The energy deposited (edep) is randomly distribued along the step (see
 SteppingAction).
     
 In order to control the accuracy of the deposition, the maximum  step size 
 of charged particles is computed automatically from the binning of 
 histograms 1 and 8 (see RunAction).
     
 As an example, this limitation is implemented as a 'full' process :
 see StepMax class and its Messenger. The 'StepMax process' is registered
 in the Physics List.
     
 StepMax is evaluated at RunAction::BeginOfRun(),
 and passed to the StepMax process. 
 A boolean UI command allows to desactivate this mechanism.
     	
 7- HISTOGRAMS
 
   Testem11 has several predefined 1D histograms : 
  
      1 : longitudinal energy profile (in MeV/mm and per event)
      2 : total energy deposited in the absorber
      3 : total track length of the primary track
      4 : step size of the primary track      
      5 : projected range of the primary track
      6 : total track length of charged secondary tracks
      7 : step size of charged secondary tracks      
      8 : longitudinal energy profile (in MeV.cm2/g), as a function of x/r0
          where r0 is the range of the primary particle 
	       
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /testem/histo/setHisto id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /testem/histo/setFileName  name  (default testem11)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file (hbook, root, XML)
   with the command /testem/histo/setFileType (root by default)
   
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /testem/histo/printHisto id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default testem11) 
       
   Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
   the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.
   
 
 8- USING HISTOGRAMS

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available. See InstallAida.txt
