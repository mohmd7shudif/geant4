     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP

                            ParticleGun 
                            -----------
			    
 History:
  10-06-2010 : Makoto Asai - merge into one example
  13-05-2010 : Michel Maire - create as three examples
  
 This example demonstrates 4 ways of the usage of G4ParticleGun shooting
 primary particles in different cases. These are
  1) Generate several vertices and particles per event
  2) Show how to sample a tabulated function (eg. energy spectrum)  
  3) Divergent beam in an arbitrary direction 
  4) Shooting primaries in spherical coordinates with rotation matrix.
 These usages can be chosen by a UI command
  /gunExample/selectGunAction <actionID>
 where <actionID> corresponds to above cases.
 	
 1- Geometry construction
    ---------------------

 It is a simple box which represents an 'infinite' homogeneous medium.
  
 2- Physics list
    ------------

 PhysicsList.cc defines only geantino and transportation process.
         	
 3- Primary generator
    -----------------

 There are 4 concrete primary generator action classes
 (PrimaryGeneratorActionN, N=1,2,3,4) which can be used as an independent sample
 code. 
 PrimaryGeneratorAction is the class which uses and switches between these 
 4 concrete action classes. Each concrete generator action shoots geantinoes
 in a distribution decribed below.

 3.1- Generate several vertices and particles per event
      -------------------------------------------------

 particle 1 : a geantino uniformly randomized on a cylinder surface.
 particle 2 and 3 : on opposite side of the cylnder surface to particle 1

 3.2- Show how to sample a tabulated function (energy spectrum)
      ---------------------------------------------------------

 Energy is sampled from a tabulated function defined in InitFunction().
 The function is assumed positive, linear per segment, continuous.
 Two sampling methods are illustrated : RejectAccept() and InverseCumul()
 (see Particle Data book, Monte Carlo techniques).
 Histogram 1 shows generated energy spectrum.
       
 3.3- Divergent beam in an arbitrary direction with rotation matrix 
      -------------------------------------------------------------

 A geantino uniformly randomized around a given direction (theta, phi). 
 One wants to limit particle direction uniformly around this direction.
 First, one generates momentum direction in the master frame (eg. World).
 AlphaMax = opening angle around z axis.
 Then one rotates momentum in local frame, using rotateUz() function.
 RotateUz() transforms uz to newUz. It is composition of two simple rotations:
 theta around oy, then phi around oz (non commutative).

 Histograms 2,3 show momentum direction in local frame.
  
 3.4- Shooting primaries in spherical coordinates with rotation matrix
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

 a geantino uniformly randomized within a spherical shell.

 a) Vertex position
 One wishes to shoot uniformly within a spherical shell.
 One works in spherical coordinates. One uses inverse cumulative method with
 analytical formulae.
 Histograms 4,5,6 demonstrate uniform distribution of vertex position.

 b) Momentum direction
 One wants to limit particle direction uniformly within (alphaMin, alphaMax).
 First, one generates momentum direction in the master frame (eg. World).
 Then, one rotates momentum in vertex_position frame, using rotateUz() function.
 RotateUz() transforms uz to ur. It is composition of two elementary rotations:
 theta around oy, then phi around oz (non commutative).
http://proj-clhep.web.cern.ch/proj-clhep/manual/UserGuide/VectorDefs/node49.html
 Histograms 7,8 show momentum direction in vertex_position frame.

 4- Visualisation
    -------------
 
 Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 Initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main 
 in case of interactive running mode.
 
 5- How to start ?
    --------------
 
  - compile and link to generate an executable
 	% cd gun
 	% gmake
 		
  - execute particleGun in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% ParticleGun   run1.mac
 		
  - execute particleGun2 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% particleGun
 	....
 	Idle>      ---> type your commands. For instance:
        Idle> /gunExample/selectGunAction 1
	Idle> /run/beamOn 10
	....
 	Idle> exit
	
 6- Histograms
    ----------
 
  particleGun produces several 1D histograms which are saved as
  particleGun.root by default.

      1 : energy spectrum dN/dE = f(E)
      2 : momentum direction: angular distr dN/dOmega = f(alpha)
      3 : momentum direction: angular distr dN/dOmega = f(psi)      
      4 : vertex position: radial  distr dN/dv = f(r)
      5 : vertex position: angular distr dN/dv = f(theta)
      6 : vertex position: angular distr dN/dv = f(phi)
      7 : momentum direction: angular distr dN/dOmega = f(alpha)
      8 : momentum direction: angular distr dN/dOmega = f(psi)

  Please note that histogram 1 will be filled only if you use 
  PrimaryGeneratorAction2, histos 2,3 with PrimaryGeneratorAction3
  and 4 through 8 will be filled with PrimaryGeneratorAction4.

  The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
  The histos can be individually activated with the command :
  /gunExample/histo/setHisto id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
  where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
  One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
  /gunExample/histo/setFileName  name  (default particleGun)
   
  It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file (hbook, root, XML)
  with the command /gunExample/histo/setFileType (root by default)
   
  It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
  /gunExample/histo/printHisto id
  All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default particleGun)

  Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
  the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.
 
  Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old files:
  	gmake histclean
  	gmake 

 7- Using histograms
    ---------------- 

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available. See the file InstallAida.txt
