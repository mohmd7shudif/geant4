                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

7 November 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Updated to CLHEP-2.1.1.0:
  Utility (W.E.Brown  <wb@fnal.gov>):
  o removing C++0X-like keywords constexpr, noexcept, and nullptr
    to avoid collision with similar symbols in other packages.

20 September 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Added missing export statements for static symbols required for DLL build.

22 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Added the CLHEP include directory to
  GEANT4_BUILDTREE_INCLUDE_DIRS so that its visible from the build tree if
  we use the internal CLHEP.

20 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Install CLHEP headers to
  CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR/PROJECT_NAME in line with new standard install
  directory structure.

14 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Build G4clhep through standard GEANT4_LIBRARY_TARGET
  macro. Keep installation of headers as is.

13 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Added use of new CMAKE_INSTALL_XXX variables to control
  installation of libraries and headers, and add exported libraries to a
  global property as per other Geant4 targets. Header paths are not added to
  a global property though because these can be internal or external, so
  we handle them higher up when generating the configuration files.

2 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : NEW file adding CMake build of 'G4clhep'
  Implemented as a single CMakeLists.txt because special handling of
  the nested header structure of CLHEP is needed at install time.

1 June 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Fixed trivial compilation warnings on gcc-4.6.0 in NonRandomEngine.h
  and Ranlux64Engine.cc for parameters defined but not used.

24 May 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Added missing files in CLHEP built-in module.
  Allow for generation of DLL library on Windows for it.

11 May 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Including a subset of CLHEP classes imported from version CLHEP-2.1.0.1.
- Modifications applied vs. original CLHEP classes:
  * Removed dependency on internal CLHEP "defs.h" configuration header;
    the Geant4 built-in module for CLHEP follows the Geant4 build scheme.
  * Adopt "std" namespace for standard mathematical functions, where needed.
  * Removed dependency on ZM exceptions and replaced with "cerr" printouts
    where necessary.
  * Renamed following files for coherency and standard:
    o Inlined code *.src to *.icc and moved to includes set;
    o DualConv.hh to DualConv.h.
  * Use coherent inclusion scheme also for internal headers/data/inline-code,
    where applicable.
  * Use of standard WIN32 compiler flag where applicable.
  * Cleared source code of de-activated debug blocks and minor cleanup,
    where applicable.
  * Rename of final CLHEP library produced, from 'CLHEP' to 'g4clhep'.
