27th December 2010  John Allison  (VRML-V09-04-00)
- Tagged.

23, December L. Garnier 
- GNUmakefile : Remove Qt stuff from Makefile

11 November 2010  Akinori Kimura (VRML-V09-03-01)
- Replaced G4cerr with G4cout and added the following line before G4cout.
  if (G4VisManager::GetVerbosity() >= G4VisManager::errors)

30th May 2010  John Allison (VRML-V09-03-00)
- G4VRML[1/2][File}SceneHandler: Added AddCompound(const G4VDigi&).

21st October 2009  John Allison  (VRML-V09-02-01 coworks greps-V09-02-02)
- Added AddCompound (const G4THitsMap<G4double>&) methods.
  o Prevents warnings about hiding - calls G4VSceneHandler base class.

29 September 2009  John Allison (VRML-V09-02-00)
- Tagged change of disclaimer on file headings (made long ago).

12th June 2006  John Allison  (VRML-V08-00-02)
- G4VRML1/2FileViewer.cc: Fixed rewind problem. ClearView closes and
  re-opens file.
- G4VRML1/2FileSceneHandler.cc: Proper terminator on exit:

2nd June 2006  John Allison  (VRML-V08-00-01)
- G4VRML2SceneHandlerFunc.icc: Protect zero model pointer.

23rd January 2006  John Allison  (VRML-V08-00-00)
- Rewind output file in G4VRML*FileViewer::ClearView.  Avoids
  duplicate geometries in output file.

27th May 2005  John Allison  (VRML-V07-00-00)
- Fixed bug introduced in ClearTransientStore.

19th April 2004  Gabriele Cosmo (VRML-V06-01-00)
- Fixed typo in printout in G4VRML1FileSceneHandler.cc and
  G4VRML2FileSceneHandler.cc.

6th November 2003  John Allison  (vis-V05-02-03)
- G4VRML2SceneHandlerFunc: changed const char* pv_name to G4String pv_name.

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo (vis-V05-02-01)
- Simplified GNUmakefile.

VRML-V05-00-00 17th February 2003 Satoshi Tanaka
- A Small bug fixing of VRML2 driver
 (Explicit cast from G4String to char*).

VRML-V04-01-00 November 10 2002
- Bug fixing for marker size (*.icc files)

VRML-V03-02-01 18th September 2001  
- Updation for automatic visualization at Hebden Bridge mini-workshop.
- Filename incrementation is made the same as the DAWNFILE driver

27th April 2000  Gabriele Cosmo
- Removed unnecessary #include "G4Transform.hh".

VRML-V01-00-00 27th December 1999  Satoshi Tanaka
- G4endl ==> "\n" for fDest objects

VRML-V00-01-01 4th November 1999  Satoshi Tanaka
- Introduction of VRMLBeginModeling() for new vis commands

VRML-00-03-07	Satoshi TANAKA	Dec 07, 1998  
- An environmental variable "G4VRML_VIEWER" is renames to 
  "G4VRMLFILE_VIEWER" for consistency.

VRML-00-03-06	Satoshi TANAKA	Dec 04, 1998  
- Maximun number of generated g4.wrl files in the destination
  directory is customizable as: "setenv G4VRMLFILE_MAX_FILE_NUM  N"
  (N is the integer greater than or equal to 1. The default value is 1.)

VRML-00-03-04	Satoshi TANAKA	Dec 03, 1998  
- Bug fix of SetPVPickability();

VRML-00-03-03	Satoshi TANAKA	Nov 30, 1998  
- Destination directiory of g4.wrl and g4_X.wrl is customizable 
  with the environmental variable "G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR".

  Unix:
   % setenv G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR   directory_name/

   For example, 

   % setenv G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR   /tmp/

   Do not forget to add "/" at the end of the directory name.

  NT: 
   DOS> set G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR   directory_name\

   Do not forget to add "\" at the end of the directory name.

- Minor change in policy of automatic incremation of output VRML file:

  OLD way: g4.wrl, g4_2.wrl, .....           , g4_100.wrl
  NEW way: g4.wrl, g4_1.wrl, g4_2.wrl, ..... , g4_100.wrl

  Maximal number of files in one directory is restricted in order to 
  avoid explosion of your hard disk. The maximal number is hard-coded.
  You can revise is by editing enum's of G4VRML1FILEScene.hh and 
  G4VRML2FILESchene.hh

  Note that the incrementation is done as follows (pseudo codes)

    filename = "g4.wrl" // initialization

    while( filename already exists in the dest directory )
    {
	  increment filename
    }

  It means that if you delete file "g4.wrl" in the destination directory,
  the file name in the next generation is still g4.wrl.

  The JAVA application VRML/g4vrmlview/g4vrmlview.java 
  for network visualization is also updated.


VRML-00-03-02	Satoshi TANAKA	Nov 13, 1998  
- Code refinement of VRML 2.0 driver
- Pickability of Physical volume is controllable with 
  setenv G4VRML_PV_PICKABLE  1/0
- Nickname of VRML drivers are renames:
  (Old names were, e.g., "VRML1File")

  VRML1 file    : VRML1FILE
  VRML1 network : VRML1

  VRML2 file    : VRML2FILE
  VRML1 network : VRML2
