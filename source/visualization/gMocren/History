22 January 2010  Gabriele Cosmo (gMocren-V09-03-00)
Fix in G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc to allow for porting on C++0x Standard:
made explicit with static_cast conversions from double to float. Also use
G4 types in consistent way.

Line 363 of G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc was deleted.
It was a debug code with G4cout.
Another file I/O bug was fixed. The following files were committed.

Fix in G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc for resolving compilation error on
Windows

5 November 2009  Akinori Kimura
GMocrenFileSceneHandler::AddCompound(G4THisMap<>) was modified
to deal with /vis/scene/add/psHits <scorer_name>.
