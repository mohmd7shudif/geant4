Introduction
============

  This license applies to all files found in this package which
  do not fall under their own explicit license.

  This license was inspired by the FreeType license, itself inspired
  by th BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses,
  which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial
  and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points
  are that :

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use
      it, or  only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge
      somewhere in your documentation that you have used the g4/tools
      code. (`credits')

  We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this
  software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
  We disclaim all warranties covering g4/tools and assume no liability
  related to g4/tools.

Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  `You' refers to the licensee, or person using g4/tools, where `using'
  is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as
  well as linking it to form a 'program' or `executable'.

  This license applies to all files distributed in the original g4/tools
  archive, including all source code, binaries and documentation,
  unless otherwise stated in a file in its original, unmodified form
  as distributed in the original archive.

  The g4/tools is copyright (C) 2010 by Guy Barrand. All rights reserved
  except as specified below.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the author and contributors nor you shall use the name
  of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
  without specific prior written permission.

  As you have not signed this license, you are not required to
  accept it. However, as the g4/tools is copyrighted material, only
  this license, or another one contracted with the author, grants
  you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using,
  distributing, or modifying g4/tools, you indicate that you understand
  and accept all the terms of this license.
