  to properly reset navigation history and optimisation in case the
  topology of the geometry has changed between runs.
  It requires simplification of all examples/tests where geometry setup
  is changed between runs.
  o Added new boolean argument (default set to TRUE) to specify if
    topology has changed. Call to DefineWorldVolume() at initialisation
    will use FALSE as value for this argument.
  o Forced open/close geometry in method ResetNavigator() to properly
    reset G4Navigator status and remove old optimisations.
