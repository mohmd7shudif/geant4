17 July V. Uzhinsky        (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-04)
   A Status of nuclear nucleon involved in an interaction is introdused.

   involved in the reggeon cascading, 3 - absorbed nucleon.

   A connection between a participant nucleon and a nuclear nucleon was
   introsuced in G4InteractionContent.

   All of these allow to improve FTF model for pion obsorption on nuclei.
   These required a lot of changes.

9 December 08, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-01-04)
- Improvement of delete operators in FTF

5 December 08, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-01-03)
- Some objects did not erase in FTFModel desructor. These lead to memory 
  leak.


2 June 08, G.Folger 		(hadr-string-diff-V09-01-02)
-  on branch geant4-09-01-patches_branch, fix compilation warning for unused 
     variables in G4FTFModel.cc
     


??????????????????????????????      (hadr-string-diff-V09-01-01)

31 March 2008 V. Uzhinsky           Tag : hadr-string-diff-V09-01-00
- G4FTFParameters.cc and G4FTFParameters.hh were copied from G4FTFCrossSection
  corresponding files.
- New files - G4ElasticHNScattering have been added. They implement elastic 
  scattering of hadron in intra-nuclear collisions in FTF model.
- The corresponding changes have been done in G4FTFModel.cc and 
  G4FTFParticipants.cc

  
24 Apr 2007 Gunter Folger  (hadr-string-diff-V08-02-00)
-  merge in change done by ftf development.
- Created History file.
